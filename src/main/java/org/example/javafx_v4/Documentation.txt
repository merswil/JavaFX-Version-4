    Part 1: Project Overview
    Project Title: JavaFX Construction Platform

    Project Story:
    The JavaFX Construction Platform project aimed to develop a user-friendly application for managing construction-related tasks
    such as land selection, customer information management, construction details selection, design visualization, and feedback
    collection. The project started with the identification of the need for a comprehensive construction management tool.
    Throughout the development process, various challenges were encountered, including UI design, data management, and user
    interaction. These obstacles were addressed through iterative development, constant communication among team members, and
    thorough testing.

    Time Breakdown:

    Planning: 20 hours
    Coding: 60 hours
    Testing: 30 hours
    Documenting: 10 hours
    Reflection:
    During the project, significant learning occurred in programming, particularly in Java and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
    concepts. The hands-on experience provided insights into designing scalable and maintainable code structures. Additionally,
    the project enhanced problem-solving skills, especially in tackling UI/UX challenges and data management issues.
